If the first "make" fails, no problems:

make html
lynx doc/iputils.html
Read section "Installation notes"...



But if "make html" fails too, check that DocBook package is installed
on your machine. If it is installed, and nevertheless "make" does not work,
delete iputils and go to sleep. The next day repeat. If even full reset
did not help, I bring apologies. :-)
