===== s20200821 =====
released August 21, 2020

* incompatible changes
Handling numeric options changed
- ping: use '.' (dot) as a decimal separator regardless locale (for -i/-W
  options). Since s20121121 till s20190709 decimal separator for -i option
  depended on locales ($LC_NUMERIC), but only when compiled with USE_IDN=yes.
  (issue #290, commit: d865d4c, 1530bc9)
- ping: temporarily allow -i option to contain trailing non-numeric characters.
  Previously only -W option allowed this (non-numeric characters were silently
  discharged), now both -i/-W print warning. This will become fatal error in
  the future. (issue: #236, #290, commit: 562e0d5)

* arping
- [security] disable setcap and setuid (prevent ARP Poisoning, issue: #203)
- fix wrong exit code for -D option (issue: #209, originally reported:
  https://github.com/void-linux/void-packages/issues/13304)
- fix -f quit on first reply (issue: #211, originally reported:
  https://bugs.debian.org/935946)
- do not fail when unsolicited ARP mode destination does not answer when use -U
  or -A  (issue: #247)

* clockdiff
- add timeformat options: -T/--time-format <ctime|iso> and -I (alias for
  --time-format=iso)
- use strftime() instead of deprecated ctime_r() (commit: d6e1d77)

* ninfod
- fix build with libcap 2.29 (issue: #246)
- fix struct qtypeinfo packing (commit: f0a6348)

* ping
- [security] use random value for the identifier field instead of PID when using
  SOCK_RAW socket
- allow user to specify VRF and source IP (commit: 9e08707)
- try next addrinfo on connect failure (fixes reachability when getaddrinfo()
  returns IPv6 results first on hosts with only IPv4 routes available, commit:
  2705c82, c249e48)
- fix IPv6 name resolution for hostnames with link-local addresses (commit: d217170)
- fix print gateway IP on little endian architectures on IPPROTO_ICMP sockets
  (commit: e2e9a2d)
- discard packets with wrong source address (comply RFC 1122, commit: 5e052ad)
- suppress duplicate reply messages when ping multicast (issue: #195,
  originally reported: https://bugs.debian.org/498429)
- allow any package size (-s) to be defined by user (issue: #210)
- use C locale for parsing -i/-W options without IDN (commit: d865d4c)
- yet another fix for round-trip time (RTT) (commit: 5b6c194, never ending
  story, see issue: #232)
- reintroduce support of flow label for very old systems (issue: #268,
  regression: s20190324, originally reported: https://bugs.debian.org/682511,
  https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/iputils/blob/0bbd37701742cc6da0e91f6cc5ba6cf6a522fca2/f/iputils-20100418-flowlabel.patch,
  originally fixes in fed7e6306f37a18 from November 2012)
- fix IPv6 error handling for old kernels without ping socket (regression: s20161105)
- move sources subdirectory (affects built binary location)

* rdisc
- report in --version whether compiled with server support

* tftpd
- stop building by default (use dnsmasq instead)
- add example xinetd file
- move sources subdirectory (affects built binary location)

* localization
- new translations: Ukrainian (100%), Turkish (100%), German (53%), French
  (40%), Portuguese (Brazil) (43%), Chinese (Simplified, zh_CN) (38%)
- updated: Japanese (84%)
- starting to manage translations via Fedora's Weblate
  https://translate.fedoraproject.org/projects/iputils/iputils/

  kernel api to provide md5 functionality (issue: #239)

- use CLOCK_MONOTONIC instead of CLOCK_MONOTONIC_RAW
- various fixes discovered via LGTM scan and clang-tidy (missing includes,
  incorrect types and declarations, etc)
- man pages spelling fixes
- refactoring

* Meson build system
- Allow to set using setcap-setuid.sh per application (commit: 054670a)

- fix static build with libidn2

* Travis CI
- switch to docker based builds to tests on different distro releases,
  including cross-compilation and musl libc (issue: #169)
