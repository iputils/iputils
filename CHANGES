===== 20240905 =====
Released September 05, 2024

Mostly ping fixes release.

* Notable changes (for details see below)
- Allow to disable reverse DNS resolution (PTR lookup) with with environment
  variable IPUTILS_PING_PTR_LOOKUP=0
- Lower max allowed -s value to 65507 (IPv4) or 65527 (IPv6). That is the
  maximum the Linux kernel supports.
- Include pre-generated man pages & HTML docs in dist tarballs. This allows to
  avoid libxslt, docbook, ... as a build dependencies.
- require meson >= 0.44
- ping has new option -3

===== s20200821 =====
Released August 21, 2020

* incompatible changes
Handling numeric options changed
- ping: use '.' (dot) as a decimal separator regardless locale (for -i/-W
  options). Since s20121121 till s20190709 decimal separator for -i option
  depended on locales ($LC_NUMERIC), but only when compiled with USE_IDN=yes.
  (issue #290, commit: d865d4c, 1530bc9)
- ping: temporarily allow -i option to contain trailing non-numeric characters.
  Previously only -W option allowed this (non-numeric characters were silently
  discharged), now both -i/-W print warning. This will become fatal error in
  the future. (issue: #236, #290, commit: 562e0d5)

* arping
- [security] disable setcap and setuid (prevent ARP Poisoning, issue: #203)

  https://bugs.debian.org/935946)
- do not fail when unsolicited ARP mode destination does not answer when use -U
  or -A  (issue: #247)

* clockdiff

  SOCK_RAW socket
- allow user to specify VRF and source IP (commit: 9e08707)
- try next addrinfo on connect failure (fixes reachability when getaddrinfo()
  returns IPv6 results first on hosts with only IPv4 routes available, commit:
  2705c82, c249e48)
- fix IPv6 name resolution for hostnames with link-local addresses (commit: d217170)
- fix print gateway IP on little endian architectures on IPPROTO_ICMP sockets
  (commit: e2e9a2d)
- discard packets with wrong source address (comply RFC 1122, commit: 5e052ad)
- suppress duplicate reply messages when ping multicast (issue: #195,
  originally reported: https://bugs.debian.org/498429)
- allow any package size (-s) to be defined by user (issue: #210)
- use C locale for parsing -i/-W options without IDN (commit: d865d4c)
- yet another fix for round-trip time (RTT) (commit: 5b6c194, never ending
  story, see issue: #232)
